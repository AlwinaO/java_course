### Learning Java with Test Automation University

This repo will showcase the work that I'm learning and evolution through the course with the independent exercises.

I'm learning Java for a software developer job and so far this course is very helpful.

Check out the course on [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/)

If you would like to add your work to the course on GitHub, check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mf2-MOl0VXY). The course instructor suggests using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (free, open source version) as an IDE for the course.
